# inverse_ising2D

The aim of this project is the inference of the ratio for each couple of spins of a 2D Ising model via the pseudolikelihood method.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

Consider a 2D Ising model with Hamiltonian

![equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H&space;=&space;-\sum_{i%3Cj}J_{ij}s_{i}s_{j})

where
- $\vec{s}$ $\equiv$ $\vec{s}$ $\equiv$ ${\left \{ s_{i} \right \}}_{i=1}^{N^{2}}$,
