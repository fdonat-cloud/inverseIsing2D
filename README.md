# inverse_ising2D
Matlab script that uses maximum pseudo-likelihood method in order to find couplings/temperature of 2D Ising model from a set of Ising configurations.
Given the 2D Ising model with hamiltonian

the direct problem consists in computing observables like energy and magnetization knowing temperature, couplings and magnetic fields, the parameters of the model. On the other hand the inverse problem consists in inferring those parameters having observed a set of configurations.
